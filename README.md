# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This repository contains machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy.

The goal of this repository is to understand how machine learning algorithms work internally by implementing the core logic manually, instead of relying on ready-made models from libraries like scikit-learn.

## Why this repository?
- To strengthen understanding of machine learning fundamentals
- To practice mathematical and algorithmic thinking
- To build a strong foundation before using high-level ML libraries

## Algorithms Included
### Supervised Learning
- [Linear Regression](./supervised/linear_regression)
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Lasso Regression

### Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering (planned)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Basic mathematics and linear algebra

## Notes
- No machine learning models from scikit-learn are used
- Only NumPy is used for calculations
- Each algorithm is implemented step by step for clarity
