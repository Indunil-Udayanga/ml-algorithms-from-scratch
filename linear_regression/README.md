# Linear Regression From Scratch

This project implements Linear Regression from scratch using Python and NumPy.

The purpose of this implementation is to understand how linear regression works internally, including weight updates and predictions, without using any machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.

## Features
- Manual implementation of Linear Regression
- Gradient Descent for optimizing weights
- Separate `fit()` and `predict()` methods
- Uses NumPy for numerical computations

## How It Works
1. Initialize weights and bias
2. Predict output using linear equation
3. Calculate error
4. Update weights using gradient descent
5. Repeat for multiple iterations

## Libraries Used
- NumPy

## Usage
This code is intended for learning purposes and educational understanding of machine learning fundamentals.
